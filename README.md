## Installation<a name="installation"></a>

First and foremost, you will want to install Node.js on your computer. Once you've installed Node, you'll be able to input your information and see a completed employee page as a result. I recommend installing the dependencies node.js offers that I've used along with this project as well. (FS & Inquirer) They are two powerful tools that can achieve a lot of great things with your projects.
